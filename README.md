This is a simple 2D gravity sim. Currently the starting conditions are random, but I plan on adding the ability to set the starting conditions.

Use up and down arrows to zoom in and out, and left and right arrows to adjust the speed scale. If you want to play around with this, download the project and open with Godot 4.2, from there you can run in editor.
